# LinkedList-Questions

LinkedList is a linear data structure which has a collection of nodes, in which each node has its own data and address of next Node.
In linkedList the first node is known as head node and last node whose next is null is known as tail of a linkedlist.

Systax of creating builtin linkedlist;
LinkedList<Integer> list=new LinkedList<>();

class Node(
int val;
Node next;

Node(int val){
this.val=val;
next=null;
}
}

We have three types of linkedlist as-
